According to the LA2050 Initiative, housing is central to a person's ability
to meet basic life needs, but affordable housing is too difficult to obtain
for too many families in Los Angeles. To bridge the housing gap, Housr is an
app that combines housing affordability calculations with other urban and community
factors in order to help people find their most desirable housing community in Los Angeles.

Using ESRI's ArcGIS map technology and ESRI's JavaScript API, Housr helps users
hone in on a neighborhood that is both affordable and has the social resources
that are most important to them, such as faith-based organizations, youth groups,
or hackerspaces. With data from data.lacity.org, Housr will also allow a user to
factor in public transportation and freeway routes. Housr uses the Location Affordability
Index, an API provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and the U.S. Department of
Transportation, to calculate housing and transportation affordability.

This project was made at Hack for LA.

Here are some screenshots of the project.
